This is my solution for the second challenge. The program uses a text box where the user must enter data as follows to make different texts appear on the screen:
TEXT A Xposition Yposition
A can be either y or 1 if you want the text to follow the mouse when the mouse is on the window
Xposition and Yposition wil represent the pixel where the text will be drawn.
For exaple:
aaaa y 10 10 will make a text aaaa that will follow the mouse on position 10 10
bbbb n 38 21 will make a text bbbb that will NOT follow the mouse on position 38 21

Atention, you must have no spaces at the end and only one space between words. Also, A must be a single character!
